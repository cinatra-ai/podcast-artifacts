// WHAT THIS SUITE CAN AND CANNOT SEE — stated here rather than left implied.
//
// `src/artifact-renderer-props.ts` is a LOCAL STRUCTURAL COPY of the SDK leaf,
// carried because the SDK does not resolve from a standalone extension
// repository, and its own header calls itself "EXACTLY equal to the leaf". This
// suite CANNOT show that. With no SDK resolvable here it compares the copy only
// against the contract written down in THIS repository: it pins the copy against
// local drift — an edit here that quietly changes the shape these displays
// render against — and nothing more. A change made to the leaf itself is
// invisible from here and is caught on the host side, by the fleet's
// conformance gate over the installed pack, not by this file. The same is true
// of the content-channel version assertion in tests/packaging.test.ts.
//
// The local props copy must stay EXACTLY equal to the SDK leaf it copies. These
// assertions are the drift detector: the string unions are frozen as runtime
// values, and a canonical-shaped snapshot must both typecheck and be accepted.
