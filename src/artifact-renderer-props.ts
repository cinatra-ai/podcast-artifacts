// The versioned, normalized, SERIALIZABLE props snapshot a Cinatra
// extension-shipped artifact renderer receives from the host.
//
// A v1 renderer requests NO host ports — it renders ONLY from this
// host-supplied authorized snapshot. Every field is plain JSON data: row
// metadata, the resolved representation, host-authorized URLs, and sanctioned
// action handles as navigational hrefs (never closures / host context). The
// host access-checks each URL BEFORE building this snapshot; the renderer just
// references them.
//
// THE SOURCE OF TRUTH IS THE SDK LEAF `@cinatra-ai/sdk-extensions/artifact-renderer-props`.
// This module is a LOCAL STRUCTURAL COPY of that leaf, declared here — and not
// imported — for one reason only: the SDK is not resolvable from a standalone
// extension repository, so importing it would break this package's own install
// and typecheck. The copy is therefore kept EXACTLY equal to the leaf: the same
// fields, and the same string unions spelled out below as frozen runtime values
// so a drift between this copy and the leaf is a test failure rather than a
// silent type lie. Replace this module with a type-only import from the leaf as
// soon as the SDK resolves from a standalone repository.
